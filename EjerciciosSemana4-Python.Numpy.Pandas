Create a sample of points that follow the equation  𝑌=𝐴𝑋+𝐵 where A = 2.5 and B = 20.
Now, plot it as either a cloud of points or a line.

X = np.random.rand(20)
Y = 2.5 * X + 20

plt.plot(X, Y)
plt.scatter(X, Y)
plt.show()







Represent the logistic, or sigmoid, function between -20 and 20. Remember its formula is:
𝑆(𝑥)=11+𝑒−𝑥=𝑒𝑥𝑒𝑥+1

X = np.linspace(-20,20,100)
Y = 1 / (1 + np.exp (-X))

plt.plot(X,Y)
plt.show()
